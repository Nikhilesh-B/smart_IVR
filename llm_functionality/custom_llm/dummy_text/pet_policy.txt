Sydney's pet-friendly culture is not lost on us. Our outdoor seating area welcomes furry companions, making it a favorite spot for pet owners. All we ask is for pets to be on leashes and well-behaved, ensuring a comfortable environment for all diners. We even have a few treats on hand for our four-legged guests!
