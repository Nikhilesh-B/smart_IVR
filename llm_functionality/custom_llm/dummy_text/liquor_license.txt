Curated by our in-house sommelier, our drink menu perfectly complements our culinary offerings. From locally brewed beers, handpicked wines, to craft cocktails, our bar is a tribute to Sydney's vibrant drinking culture. Especially notable are our weekday happy hours, running from 4-6 pm. These feature exclusive drink promotions and cocktail specials, offering a perfect wind-down experience after a busy day in the CBD.
