Nikhilesh's Down Under Pizzeria takes immense pride in sourcing the freshest ingredients. Our tomatoes hail from farms in the hinterlands of Byron Bay, renowned for their sun-ripened juiciness. The flour for our crusts is milled in small batches in the Barossa Valley, ensuring a perfect base every time. Our cheeses are a testament to Australia's dairy prowess, with mozzarella from Victoria and feta from Tasmania. For those seafood toppings? They're straight from the clear waters of the Pacific, ensuring every bite is a taste of Australia's finest.
