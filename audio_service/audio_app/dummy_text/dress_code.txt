Our motto is 'Come as you are, but make it special.' While Nikhilesh's maintains a casual atmosphere during the day, we lean towards a smart-casual vibe in the evenings, especially on weekends. We believe dressing up adds to the dining experience, making it memorable. While there's no strict dress code, we appreciate it when our patrons put in a little effort, echoing the care we put into every dish we serve.
