The story behind "Nikhilesh's Down Under Pizzeria" is as flavorful as our pizzas. Nikhilesh, an Australian of Indian origin, dreamt of blending the warmth of Aussie hospitality with his passion for pizzas. 'Down Under', an affectionate colloquialism for Australia, reflects this ethos. The name is a tribute to the land he calls home and his journey of blending diverse cultures on a pizza plate.
