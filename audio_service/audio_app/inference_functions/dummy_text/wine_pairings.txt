A pizza is only as good as the drink accompanying it. At Nikhilesh's, our in-house sommelier, Isabella, has crafted a wine list that perfectly complements our menu. Dive into our Margherita with a glass of crisp Hunter Valley Chardonnay or elevate our spicy pepperoni with a bold Shiraz from the Yarra Valley. More of a beer enthusiast? We've sourced craft beers from local Sydney breweries, each chosen to enhance your pizza experience. Let our servers guide you, ensuring each sip and bite is in perfect harmony.
