We're proud of our drink menu, but we also appreciate the personal touch of a wine brought from home. Nikhilesh's is BYO wine-friendly, and patrons can bring their preferred bottle for a nominal corkage fee of $10. Our staff is trained to handle and serve your wines with the same care as our own, ensuring the best dining experience.
