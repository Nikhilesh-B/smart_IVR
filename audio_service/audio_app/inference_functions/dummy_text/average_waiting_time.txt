Nikhilesh's prides itself on efficiency without compromising on the quality of your dining experience. On average weekdays, our waiting time ranges between 10-15 minutes. However, on weekends or during special events, this might extend up to 30 minutes. We recommend reservations, especially for larger groups, to minimize waiting. For those who do wait, our bar area offers a delightful space to sip on a drink until your table is ready.
